The mapping of a temperature sensor, a room and a zone may change
depending on how much information we know:
* Situation 1: we know relationship between a temperature sensor and a room,
  but we don't know which HVAC zone that room is in.
* Situation 2; we know relationship between a temperature sensor and a HVAC zone,
  but we don't know which rooms are in the HVAC zone.

The logic of how a thing works is different from the fact that there is one.

physical graph, hvac graph, lighting graph, electrical graph, spatial graph.
These share share nodes between each other, BUT there is no logic on the nodes.
These subsystem graphs will have their own special set of relations
- spatial: next to, connected to

maybe controllers are in the HVAC view?
